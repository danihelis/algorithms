# Graphs

This section contains common algorithms for graph manipulation. Graphs are often
used to represent data whose elements are interconnected pairwise, such as a
map with roads connecting cities, or a network with nodes connected by links.

* [Graph representation](./representation.md): matrix and adjacency list
* [Graph traversal](./traversal.md): DFS, BFS and topological sort
* [Components](./connection.md): connected components, articulation points,
  flood fill
* [Shortest paths](./path.md): single path, all paths, negative distances
* [Minimal spanning trees](./path.md): using disjoint sets or BFS
* [Network flow](./maxflow.md): maximum flow
