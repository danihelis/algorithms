# Graphs

This section contains common algorithms for graph manipulation. Graphs are often
used to represent data where its elements are interconnected pairwise, such as a
map with roads connecting cities, or a network with nodes connected by links.
To be more precise in the definitions, we make heavy use of mathematical
notation, defined in each section.
