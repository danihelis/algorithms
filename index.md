# Summary

A selection of common and useful algorithms written in ANSI C. They cover the
following subjects:

* [Data structures](structure/index.md)
* [Graphs](graph/index.md)


# About

These algorithms were written as part of my personal study of competitive
programming problems. You can see 
    [a list of my solutions here](https://github.com/danihelis/uva-solutions).
The source code of this wiki can be found
    [here](https://github.com/danihelis/algorithms).

Even though I wrote or adapted most of the code of this wiki (and I assume all
mistakes they may contain), these algorithms were taken from many recommended
sources.
