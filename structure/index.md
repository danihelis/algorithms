# Data structures

This section contains basic algorithms for general data structures and their
time complexity. They are used to insert and query data based on an integer key
field, and vary on their efficiency. Modern programming languages already
provide most of these structures builtin.

One data structure that does not appear here is binary tree. Instead of
presenting a simple version of binary tree, which is unbalanced and possibly not
efficient, I decided to present a B-tree, which is rarely used in contests, but
is a safer alternative.


* [Vectors](./vector.md)
* [Linked lists](./linked-list.md)
* [Stacks](./stack.md)
* [Queues](./queue.md)
* [Hash tables](./hashtable.md)
* [Heaps](./heap.md)
* [B-trees](./b-tree.md)
* [Segment trees](./segment-tree.md)
* [Union-find disjoint sets](./set.md)
