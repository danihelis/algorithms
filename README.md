# Repository of algorithms

A selection of common and useful algorithms written in ANSI C. They cover a wide
range of subjects: basic data structures, string processing, mathematics,
geometry, graphs and dynamic programming.

You can access the documents at [danihelis.github.io/algorithms/](/https://danihelis.github.io/algorithms/).

### Sources

These algorithms were written as part of my personal study of competitive
programming problems. You can see [a list of my solutions here](#).

Even though I wrote or adapted most of the code of this wiki (and I assume all
errors that eventually exist), these algorithms were taken from many recommended
sources.
